This event is emitted to stencil to move a stencil. It emits, for example, by [DraggableArea]('/components/draggable-area.html) component.

This event is represented by `MoveEvent` class instance that has two fields:
- `directions` is the object with `left` and `top` fields, that tells to move stencil at `left` pixels horizontally and `top` pixels vertically

	top: topShift
}))
```
