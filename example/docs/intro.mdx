# Getting started

## Introduction

This react cropper library is built on the [`advanced-cropper`](https://github.com/Norserium/advanced-cropper) core. It's the official
binding for React and it belongs to the advanced croppers family that based on the same core and philosophy.

### Motivation

The motivation to create the new cropper was simple: the web needed to have the library that give developers possibility to create really
customized cropper on one hand and give users a smooth and lovely experience on the other hand.

I hope that there is at least one such cropper.

## Package installation

To use this library you should install it with `npm` or `yarn`

```shell
npm install -S react-advanced-cropper
```

```shell
yarn add react-advanced-cropper
```

Then import the `Cropper` component and the styles somewhere:

```ts
import { Cropper } from 'react-advanced-cropper'
import 'react-advanced-cropper/dist/style.css';
```
## Minimal working example

The example below shows the usage of the cropper inside some arbitrary component.

<GettingStartedExample/>

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { CropperRef, Cropper } from 'react-advanced-cropper';
import 'react-advanced-cropper/dist/style.css'

export const GettingStartedExample = () => {
	const [image, setImage] = useState(
		'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1599140849279-1014532882fe?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1300&q=80',
	);

	const onChange = (cropper: CropperRef) => {
		console.log(cropper.getCoordinates(), cropper.getCanvas());
	};

	return (
		<Cropper
			src={image}
			onChange={onChange}
			className={'cropper'}
		/>
	)
};
```

If you need to change the behavior of the cropper (for example, you want to create a fixed one for mobile devices),
please read [this detailed article](/docs/guides/cropper-types) about the different variants of croppers.
