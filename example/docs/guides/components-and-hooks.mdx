# Components / hooks

## Cropper

Probably, you should use only `Cropper` component as in the recipes. But sometimes you need to understand how cropper works internally.
And it's based on some components and hooks. That's about this guide.

Components and hooks are wrappers for the cropper state and its modifiers. They are organized in the following structure:

<ComponentsHierarchy/>

That's the basic hierarchy of common cropper. Each of the components and hooks has own specific task, but all of them can be grouped in the following categories:

### Work with the cropper state

#### `useAbstractCropperState`

This hook is the most important in all of the cropper parts.

It wraps all of [the state modifiers](test), provides the interface for state manipulation and add the new concepts:
- **Transitions**: the way to tell the components when transitions should be enabled;
- **Postprocess**: the special functions that applies to result of different actions (actually to a new state) before state will be updated. The most common scenario is the creating auto zoom.


#### `useCropperState`

This hook is a wrapper of the `useAbstractCropperState`. That hook doesn't define [the cropper settings](any) and any other
properties, therefore this hook provides the default settings (ones that `withDefaults` function provides) and add default `autoZoom` postprocess function.

### Work with the cropper image

#### `useCropperImage`

This hook provides the simple way to load image and gets `CropperImage` instance for it (with parsed basic transforms). Also it gives the consumer
the possibility to display loading, unloading image process easialy and without pain.

### Interact / visualize the cropper state

#### `CropperWrapper`

This component wraps the cropper itself. It can be used to inject some content in the cropper, to customze image loading and etc.

#### `CropperBackgroundWrapper`

This component that wraps cropper background and stencil. It process touch and mouse events to transform image.

#### `CropperBackground`

This component is used to display cropper image. It's recommended to use it to display the image, because it handle transforms and transitions
internally in the convenient way.

#### `Stencil`

It's the custom component, that is used to display the current cropped area and change it by interaction with it.


#### `useMoveImageOptions`

The auxiliary hook, that can be used to parse `MoveImageOptions` object and transform them into the actual options with default values.

#### `useScaleImageOptions`

The auxiliary hook, that can be used to parse `ScaleImageOptions` object and transform them into the actual options with default values.

### Service

#### `StretchableBoundary`

This component is the auxiliary component that gives the possibility to stretch it easily to the image size. It's very conveniently for
adaptive croppers.

#### `CropperCanvas`

This component is the auxiliary component to draw the cropped area on canvas.

## Stencil

Stencil can be literally any arbitrary component, but to make sense there are some requirements to it:

- it should be inscribed to box is represented by coordinates (width, height, left, top)
- if stencil has aspect ratios it should has `aspectRatios` method to inform the cropper resize algorithm about it (this method should return object with minimum and maximum aspect ratio values)
- it should have `onResize`, `onResizeEnd`, `onMove`, `onMoveEnd` props
- it should display the cropped part of a image
- it should display the overlay around the stencil

However the default stencils (`RectangleStencil` and `CircleStencil`) and most of other custom stencils have the following structure:
